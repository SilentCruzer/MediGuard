Traditional record-keeping methods have failed us in several ways. One of the main reasons is the lack of transparency in the process. It is difficult to verify the authenticity of paper records, and they are often subject to corruption and tampering. Additionally, paper records are fragmented, making it difficult to keep track of a patient's complete medical history. 

The introduction of web3, DID's, and ZK-proof technology provides the highest level of security and privacy for digital documents. Patients can control who has access to their medical records, and healthcare providers can access the necessary information without compromising patient's privacy.
